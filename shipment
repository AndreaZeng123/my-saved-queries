#here is a query you can use to get shipping data from HSC. You will have to join by set id

SELECT DISTINCT set_id, DATE(shipDate) AS ship_date
FROM `bcs-csw-core.velocity.shipment_summary`,
UNNEST(setIdsInShipment) AS set_id
WHERE DATE(shipDate) >= '2024-03-13' --min in cassette dashboard is 3/14
